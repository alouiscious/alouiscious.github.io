Finally a project I understand as SQL explained as easy as excel and routes  - the framework behind all of the web builder apps I’ve used.
I understand the beginning structures of passwords and a little encryption, and selection and sorting methods.

Rest and crud are going to be created for me in the next module of study, but the underpinnings now make sense.

The challenge of this final project in not to get too caught up in the UX/UI abilities. The introduction of CSS tempts me to tweek the look of this project and not the route. Focus on the route, ultimately led to the most sensible UX/UI anyway. 
So great lesson!

Tour like bettye is an app that guides fledgling performing artists toward their greatest performance by assisting with the search of great places to play based on venues that proved successful starting point for seasoned performing artists.
The app has a visitor named a User that creates an account which included a user name and password.
The user can then access a list of venues from which they will choose tour stops.
These tour stops become the  customized tour they can research and create contact and notes about the venues found herein.
The user has access to editing their personal account details, editing the chosen venues, and adding/editing custom venues not found in the master list of venues.
Once the user has made a few selections, they then can manage their tour with details about each venue and the progress they’ve made with contacting the venues for a performance contract.

At time of this writing, the requirements for this final project have been met  despite not coding all or some of the features list above.
