Vaulted and 'stacked' the landing!

This blog details the path to culmination.
With every culmination there are the weeds, of course, to manage.

Some how stuck a landing with this full-stack program and discover a lot about myself and the coding world as it remains.

Moderations to whole published networks like parlar and the likes, combined with a year or more off from music performance, and civil unrest and politico dropped on their heads...
### This really poses the question...
## ...Who am I coding for anyway?

With the spirit of the individual who has a lot of idol time, 2020 changed so much that I can’t consciously code for the same projects and causes, for which I envisioned and planned within the last 14 months.

*Everything changed, and change is unavoidably good.*

While i planned to recode my pro touring app and expected to have scrape data to support the most common venues in the  country. 'Tour Like Betttye'™ is on hold and the 'VoxAct'™ app has the green light now.

It seemed more applicable to create an app that reintroduces performing talents to agents and talent buyers. I'm hoping the stasis of our community will interact with something that fosters connection. 

But its not like I want to code for a dating app with winks and hearts post and replies. I could not sustain the maintenance.
I'm hoping as meaningful as it can be to find your life partner, at time when life is truly precious; it can be equally important to apply the time folks have had to hone their crafts.

Perhaps during a shut down we can make ready amazing production shorts, auditions and photos shoots and present a well prepared collection of talent.

So VoxAct™ attempts to help users create an account and  add a profile page where they post talents and contact information to provide a showcase to interested parties.

In this pre-release version of VoxAct™ you can view a list of all users, but features like the access to every users' details and their talents are slated for a later release. A new model for talent buyer/agent will have elevated account access to create talent rosters and view all the apps available talents and auditions.

With this pre-release version  a user can create an account, sign in to their profile, and toggle between editing a profile page where they add talents, create links to media files, view their profile, and sign out when they are done.

Connections, compassion and showcasing in small portions, digitally produced and published. 

VoxAct™ helps the performers woodshed time and commitment to craft shine.

Hope you enjoy VoxAct™
