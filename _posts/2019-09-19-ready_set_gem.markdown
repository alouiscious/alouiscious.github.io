On the first day of the Part-Time 071519 Flatiron Sofware Engineers Online program, our cohort co-instructor lead a study group detailing what we could expect to cover in the two month module.
Of course, I had a limited understanding of what the heck my instructor was talking about. Also I discovered I was not alone in my lack of prowess, when other cohort members lapsed in to cricket mode when answers and comments were solicited. I had no idea until last Sunday, how valuable that first video would become or how far I perceived I had come in preparation for completing this Module 1 of 5 - final project.

Up until now, I've had no ideas about what I would apply terms like API, Gem, Scraping. 
So to see there is such a simple way to access and utilize certain data and resources to tweak some of my favorite topic or realize the foundations for a very good first app/gem ever; blew my mind.

My CLI Gem Demo is titled ~ Tour Like Bettye. I intend to use this project throughout the program to create a legacy product that exemplifies the tools and tacticts I've used to become a successful music performer and touring artist.

I started not knowing where to start. Love that!
I discovered despite due diligence, reviewing all the recorded study groups, and factoring and refactoring many line of code. My overall experience was I learn a ton. I listened carefully to pointers and found I learned a ton. So much that I can't stop improving my gem and asking more questions. 

I wanted to be finished, i did not want to be the last one to finish, and then I began to not care if the code was wrong and I couldn't stop trying the several ways to scrape different websites and create concise objects.

Whatever i found I did not understand, I was coached toward a solution but still allowed to discover the many ways to solve one single problem.
I'm pretty proud of my little gem.

# Not until your sure
I did not know if my project ideas would fit this assignment until I described it to my instructor. I've felt it was a good idea for an app, and created a app map and wiring  harness for this app last year. But like writing a new song for your band, you just not sure it's worth a damn until you share it with others.

So my idea is for the creation of a gem to introduce the Tour Like Bettye app.
Its purpose is to create a  musicians'  touring guide.

User design - think tank
App intro - defines the purpose and my passion of the app
App features - bullet list of venues define CLI menu

menu
This Demo Projects Scope
List venues
Venues description
List features artist tours
List concerts and festivals

Since you're sure, keep working.
Start with the entry point - the file run when?
Force that to build the CLI interface
Stem out the interface
Start making things real

# scrape the bottom for results
Scraping for content is tricky at best. Once i got used to using the inspect development tools in the web browser things began to flow a little better. However, without time to write my own spec testing files for the project, scraping was at best tedious. To quickly get the results I was after in my scraped data, I had to stop work and learn to use Repl.it. A day later, I could see scraping tests a lot faster. Seeing many scraping results at a quick pace is what led to reading the HTML tags  fluently, and to be able to more quickly determine if a sight was good for scraping.

Despite the mostly decent scraping results, I would like to investigate how to produce the same gem using an API next time, and plan to make a point to return to  developing a good SQL database and API for the Tour Like Bettye full app.

# the gem building and CLI creation 
I started with a gem builder site that quickly created the folder and files i needed in my VS code environment.
My paring partner helped a bit with showing me which files I should alter to escape the onslaught of errors after the builder was done.

After my builder was set, I discovered I had several files connected to a completely different part of my GitHub Repo. So to remedy, I had to learn and verify my entire local environment using VS Code was working. Once this was done, I had to build the folder set and my gem again. Though, this practice a second time really solidified the process.

Next, I discovered I knew what each element was needed for the project, but I had know idea where anything went or how the methods and classes and modules namespaced should be structured. The best part about this was it forced me to carefully review my notes and revisit videos; so, I quickly became a user of the help link on the learn.co website, instruct.learn.co, and our recorded study group session. I was then able to link and identify the ruby and executable files with the best understanding of all of that - to date.

I'd like to plan more time to learn and apply better regexp  and string methods to the scraping process.

So all said and done, and after all that I loved it and I can't wait to do the next one.

Onward and upward!
