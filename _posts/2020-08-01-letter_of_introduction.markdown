My name is Renee, and I'm writing today with the hope of presenting a small window into my life journey, and my unique return to work.

For the first time in my life I am joining the working world after the longest hiatus ever.
It seemed only appropriate to share this journey in my blog. This is meant to be as much of an introduction for you to me as it is a reintroduction to myself. 

If you like this read, I’d like to especially assist folks entering the work force for the first time. Those graduates or those making a transitional pivot after our world-wide COVID outbreak. Making and maintain your employability is truly an art.

As coders, we may be the lucky ones. The reliance of web delivered markets, medical research, and housing deficits; just to name a few, should continue to crack the coding job markets wide open. The entire industry should pivot in a way it did at the first installation of Microsoft Word and Word Perfect. The onset of the WYSIWYG coding creation apps will soon infiltrate the common workspace, and drive the need for “actual” developers to manage divisions of big data and software engineers.

Hence I digress, I am starting back to work after an injury in my store and a partial disability is restricting me from physical requirements of my role as a Creative Trainer. I’ve been a media and tech teacher for 20 years, and I can’t raise my arms now or lean forward to engage with my clients and there devices. I did return to my classroom three times since my injuries; but simple movements (e.g., balance, opening drawers, carrying equipment) were difficult, and in some cases severely exacerbated my symptoms. 

Despite many therapies, I spent more than a year on the couch.  I knew my rehabilitation could not exist without challenging my mind and considering a few changes. I mean the signs to which we pay attention are the exhaustion of Playstation options and the addition on musicals and Audrey Hepburn movies to the DVR.
 
So...

With my newly acquired at home status, the loss of practicing active work motivations and team activities or projects was oddly devastating. This propelled me to discover how best to practice seeing our customers and students ~ without being able to physically see each other.

Constantly renewing so much love and pride for my employer. How does one translate in-person interactive Sessions, Field Trips, Features, and Kids’Camp? Educational adventures are a cozy part of my role, and I’m elated our marketing measures growth through experiences. I enjoy having every known tool at my disposal for communicating with all clients, and preparing interactive experiences for domestic and international deployment. 

Re-adjusting for making decisions to accurately react to state of the industry needs and trending activities or products; perhaps I can break down the common resistance to new technology or equipment; whereby, becoming more knowledgable creating a kind peace among the masses and their devices.





Best for this position…

In the toughest of situations and the highest lines of pressure, I am known for developing and explaining easy to follow processes that foster ownership.

I love listening for best practices, educating self through colleagues and customers,  exemplifying genuine interest in service and most of all, practice composure. 

Curating content and materials, and listening when presenting memorable interactions, I’ve created approachability leading peers, and inspiration for our customers.

I am a public speaker, an events classrooms manager, and I’m known for celebrated results.
I've achieved 100% but average quarterly 92% NPS. 

Lots of Notes…
Completing a full stack software engineering program.
After two decades experience all apple Macs and Mobiles, Pro Apps, and iApps; to simplify and hone exceptional mentoring, means ambiguity is the norm. 

I truly enjoy the beauty and the bumps of customer’s experiences. Successes occur by tapping into customer focus or passions, and listening for forecast human reactions or relations to our products. This is my jam.
 
The bottom line is... I just love to help people, and hope they feel I value them allowing me to help. I believe this new position will provide a deeper understanding and access to my employers programs, device accessibility, and help each of us to ownership of global innovative directions. 

I can offer complete solutions by conveying uncomplicated audio and stage Logic Pro, Bookkeeping, Medical Legal Classroom and Museum systems, and bring these talents to an Advisor Customer Support or Team Leader of those roles. 

That’s all good and wonderful, but not nearly as challenging as to practice for our remote customers… To deliver in-store experiences. I’m ready to reach out through the phones and serve up our culture of technology; and if I'm lucky, create a legacy renewing  learning and customer connectivity.

Each iteration of my employer’s customer programs promotes successful support of customer journey, retail operations, and leadership teams. While embracing new workflows, services implementations, best practices, I can quickly adapt constant evolution technology, and to your specific team.

Throughout this two year long injury, I kept in mind the future occupational transition. I spent the last four months using the course-work from my enrollment in Flatiron School’s Software Engineering program to train for work accommodation scenarios like an eight hour day at a standing/seated desk.

Please know that I love my dear sweet classroom tenure; however, in my eighth year in the field, it’s time I transition to a Home Office role. Later I plan a release to add an Apple Office role. 

For now, please consider my introduction.
