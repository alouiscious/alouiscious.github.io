I'm writing today with the hope of presenting a small window into my recent journies, and my unique return to work.

For the first time in my life I am joining the working world after the longest hiatus ever.
It seemed only appropriate to share this journey in my blog. This is meant to be as much of an introduction for you to me as it is a reintroduction to myself. 

As coders, we may be the lucky ones. The reliance of web delivered markets, medical research, and housing deficits; just to name a few, should continue to crack the coding job markets wide open. The entire industry should pivot in a way it did at the first installation of Microsoft Word and Word Perfect. The onset of the WYSIWYG coding creation apps will soon infiltrate the common workspace, and drive the need for “actual” developers to manage divisions of big data and software engineers.

If you like this read, I’d like to especially assist folks entering the work force for the first time. Those graduates or those making a job journey transitional pivot after our world-wide COVID outbreak. Making and maintain your employability is truly an art.

Hence I digress, I am starting back to work after an injury in my store and a partial disability is restricting me from physical requirements of my role as a Creative/Technology Trainer. I’ve been a media and tech teacher for 20 years, and I can’t raise my arms now or lean forward to engage with my clients and there devices. I did return to my classroom three times since my injuries; but simple movements (e.g., balance, opening drawers, carrying equipment) were difficult, and in some cases severely exacerbated my symptoms. 

Despite many therapies, I spent more than a year on the couch. I knew my rehabilitation could not exist without challenging my mind, along with considering a few deep life changes. I mean, I'm pretty sure the red flags to which we pay attention and provoke challenges in our lives should be the exhaustion of Playstation options and the addition of musicals and Audrey Hepburn movies to the DVR.
 
So...

Constantly renewing so much love and pride for my employer. How does one translate in-person highly-interactive Sessions, Field Trips, Features, and Kids’Camps? Educational adventures are a cozy part of my role, and I’m elated our marketing measures growth through experiences. I enjoy having every known tool at my disposal for communicating with all clients, and preparing interactive experiences for domestic and international deployment. 

Re-adjusting for making decisions to accurately react to state of the industry needs and trending activities or products; perhaps I can break down the common resistance to new technology or equipment; whereby, becoming more knowledgable creating a kind peace among the masses and their devices. 

These are the items i like to hoop jump. It's more like restructuring going to play double-dutch on my lunch break to the mundacity on the office water cooler. Yet worse, the water cooler is in my dang kitchen. With my newly acquired at home status, the loss of practicing active work motivations and team activities or projects was oddly devastating. This propelled me to discover how best to practice seeing our friends, co-workers, customers and students ~ without being able to physically see each other.

Best for this position…

Throughout this two year long injury, I kept in mind the impending occupational transitions. After giving in to my (pre- world-wide COVID outbreak) transitional pivot, I applied for and was awarded an Edie Windsor Scholarship. Whereby, I enrolled in New York's Flatiron School - Full Stack Software Engineering Program. Joyfully bending my coding brains over a barrel, I spent the last four months using the course-work from this program to train for work accommodation scenarios like an eight hour day at a standing/seated desk or fully reclined chair.

Please know that I love my dear sweet company's classroom tenure; however, in my eighth year in the field for them, it’s time I transition to a Home Office role. Later I plan a release to add an Apple Office role. So in the mean time, I'm bundling all of the best Flatiron coding labs and life/work lessons into this July 2020 return to work. 

From the home office, in which I compose this blog and other solutions by phone, I've made ready for the toughest of situations and the highest lines of pressure. Here again, I am known for developing and explaining easy to follow processes that foster ownership and dedication to my newly found coding love. 

I love listening for best practices, educating self through colleagues and customers,  exemplifying genuine interest in service and most of all, practice composure. While listening and curating content and materials, and when presenting memorable interactions, I’ve re-created approachability leading peers, and inspiration for our customers. I am a public speaker, an events classrooms manager, and I’m known for celebrated results. I've achieved 100% but average 92% customer ratings. 


Take lots of notes...
It takes lots of notes to complete a full stack software engineering program.
After decades' experience with all apple Macs and Mobiles, Pro Apps, and iApps; to simplify satisfactory results and hone exceptional mentoring, means ambiguity is the absolute norm. I truly enjoy the beauty and the bumps of customer’s experiences. Successes occur by tapping into customer focus or passions, and listening for human reactions or relations to our products. This is my jam.
 
The bottom line is... I just love to help people, and hope they feel I value them for allowing me to help. I believe this new venture in to coding will provide a deeper understanding and access to my employers programs, device accessibility, and help each of us to ownership of global innovative directions. 

I can offer complete solutions by conveying uncomplicated audio and stage Logic Pro, Bookkeeping, Medical Legal Classroom and Museum systems, and bring these talents to an Software Devlopement, Support or even a Team Leader of those roles. 


Working Remotely... 
Each iteration of my client interactions and future team's dev programs, promotes successful support of every customer journey, retail operations, and leadership teams. While embracing new workflows, services implementations, best practices, I can quickly adapt constant evolution technology, and to your specific team.

That’s all good and wonderful and a large enough challenge, but not nearly as challenging as to build a practice for remote employers and customers… To deliver personal personable experiences. I’m ready to reach out through the ether and serve up a new culture of technology; and if I'm lucky, create a legacy renewing learning, code, and client connects.

For now, please consider my re-introduction, Renee
