To think Sinatra was only the basis for serious refactoring of everything we learned sofar, and Rails will refactor everything again.

Easy to say how fast time flys. However time with the coding curriculum and materials is all i want.
More than anything else i wish while learning the skills at hand, I have the time to drill and speed challenge everything.

So like the holidays, just when you're gearing up to make all the holiday event and visits happen; it seems they are nearly over. Coding so far is nearly the same, by the time I finally own a concept, the concept either abstracts, refactors, or i'm on to the next new coding theme.

Can't wait to dress up for the next occassion. At least I know I'll have the choice of cooking it myself, ordering the store's home-cooked version or sharing the meal at a relative's house.
