**Why is the coding world the best new place for me to be?

Last I checked, I have been working with my voice, 60 hours per week for the last 20 years.
How did my voice become so overused? I sing in performance groups while working as a technology pro and teacher. But my voice is tired, people. Show biz winches and riggings needs to become syntax hashes and symbols.

In 2017, I was introduced to Code.org and an Hour of Code; not as a student, but as a teacher.
The team of tech trainerswith which I work, dubbed me the one most qualified to teach it.

I was amazed that attendees I'd never seen at our location before, came out of the woodwork with their kids and took the certificate class. So with this introduction to Swift Playgrounds, I was immediately hooked.

I finished the first three level of Swift, and began to research a way to support my newest passion. One thing that is true with discovering all of the ways to learn more about coding, if you get stuck; you get REALLY stuck. The deluge into the ridiculous amounts of coding tutorials online is deafening.

Installing a local environment for each coding tutorial was different form the last. 
Pro - local runs provide more stability, their differences are interesting — i.e. how they split the screen, some come with layout tools, their tutorials can show you things more generic about coding in many languages.
Con - too many of them and you forget which one are linked to your active project, too many tools I know nothing about, cant link them to the next coding project, limited to no support from the coding organization unless you're a member.

However, even with the correct environment and coding project running, if I did not understand the solution, there was no one to ask. So my experience was a rabbit trench of googling the solution. This became useful at times, but mostly forced me to begin to throw things at my solution. Change the brackets, switch the order of each statement, swap the variables in the equation, and losing any process of elimination.Landing at Flatiron confirmed a lot of things for me. First of all, I’m making a profound commitment. Changing my focus from teaching to learning has been miraculous. 

I recently had a very much needed vocal chord surgery.  I could not talk for ten days. It was practically a vacation to not speak to ANYONE, and allowed me to focus on completing the prep-work for Flatiron.

Now, while I still wish to continue teaching, however, a voice-less epiphany explained to me, it is more useful to teach how to create highly personalized coding solutions; rather than teach problem solving that can only be repeated if the student remembers the lesson or comes back to  see me. If the tutorial I create is interactive, duplicatable, and deliverable in small apps and doses, the student experience and success is accelerated.

If a company can build and app for customer management that fits the company functions and mission like a glove, then the performers in that company will have streamlined success. Their customers wont be confused about the companies mission or function; and if the app is as personable as the company, customer stay engaged.

Coding as many intricate features as you can to compete with the person in the cubicle next to you may be worth a promotion, but is not sustainable to a real world user of the code. Can I be part of the beginning to the end of feature-full apps that have no personality? Can I be a part of the end to cyber-crimes?

One last tidbit of rant to launch my next level to this journey. Like the Queen song, "I Want It All." I want fluency in several languages, I want to be a full-stack coder, I want to minor in data-analytics, I want to introduce others to a career in coding, I want to teach and learn at new levels. Moreover, I want to work hard, I love to work hard, and be a mentor to others who like that as well. 

I want to be a great student; so, here at Flatiron is where I shall exploit this desire to the fullest. Why Flatiron, because I can ask questions, because i'm not alone — there a whole cohort of people like me going through the same contortions and learning curves as I am. Because the teaching staff at Flatiron is kind and practices lead learning. They don't just give you the answers or prepare step by step lectures to regurgitate, they lead you to the answer and drop lots of hints.

So even though I'm moving through the material really slow, I'm talking less and I am deeply learning. 
more like that...
