This is what SQl feels like. It's weird to see data analytics at its core place. The leaps we have made from this point to apps like Numbers, Excel, Filemaker and MS Access.

I will say, as much as I've had to mess with all of those apps over the years, it is quite rewarding to think some poor coder had to manipulate the data on the SQL level.
Oh wait,... that's me!

It is refreshing to finally have finished my CLI project.
I hope to have a good experience with my reivew on Monday.
