<p>Mission and Contribution
<br />I wish to maximize my passion for coding with great apps and user interface creation. I plan to teach coding while working as a software developer / media administrator. 
<br />It’s important to help make this world a little easier, and to share the “coding bug” I have experienced with others.
<br />I am seeking opportunities to assist or lead social justice, artist and technology projects, prepare deliverables for multi media publications. 
<br />I am known for and especially thrive at flushing out best practices, creating workflows, predicting implementation issues, and steadily adjusting for ambiguity when the planning or scope of a production / studio must change. I enjoy the tech industry as it continues to provide innovations which foster deeper conversations codecs and protocols. 
<br />Along with being part of the top creative training teams at Apple, I have specialized in live acoustic/electronic music, integrated MIDI, music performance, and hundreds of A/V productions. I’ve taken my personal performances and recording career to eight countries and been an early tiered GRAMMY award nominee. </p>
